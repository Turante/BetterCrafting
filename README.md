# BetterCrafting
A Stardew Valley mod that adds tabs to the crafting page

The categories can be edited using the 'categories.json' file in the mod folder. 
Note: If there are recipes not added in the categories file, they will automatically be added to the 'Misc' tab.

## Compatibility
- Requires SMAPI 2+
- Should be compatible with both Stardew Valley 1.2 (with SMAPI 2+) and the 1.3 beta

Note: I've only tested this mod on the beta so 1.2 support isn't guranteed,
however, if there are any bugs reported I will try to fix them. 
- This mod should be compatible with any mod that doesn't modify the crafting menu

Note: The old crafting menu can still be accessed with the 'Organize' button on the
right side of the screen.
